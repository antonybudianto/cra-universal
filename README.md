## Installation

```sh
# Install global CLI (also works as a package)
npm install -g cra-universal

# Change dir to your app and init CRA server
cd ./my-create-react-app
cra-universal init

# Install server dependencies
cd ./server
npm install
```

## Client code change

Please update your render method on `src/index.js`

```js
// before
ReactDOM.render(...)

// after
ReactDOM.hydrate(...)
```

## Development

```sh
# Start your CRA client
# Recommended when developing client side
npm start

# or you can run dev server when developing server side
## make sure you've started CRA client
## then change directory to server
cd ./server

## start server, you can open http://localhost:3001
npm start
```

## Production

```sh
# Change directory to your project root first, and run:
cra-universal build

# This command will build both client and server and put them into `./dist`
```

## Deployment

1.  First, follow the Production guide mentioned above.
2.  Since the bundle used [Webpack Node Externals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-node-externals), you need to run `npm install --production` on the copied `/dist`, but this time you don't need to install its `devDependencies`
3.  Use process manager like [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) to run your server, your run target is ./dist/build/bundle.js
