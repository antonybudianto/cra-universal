### GitHub issue is for issue/bugs/feature-request tracker, NOT your app's issue

If you have issue specific to your needs/problems, please do:
- **READ** the README.md and wiki properly
- Make sure your problem is really about cra-universal's **bug**, not **wrong usage**
- Ask on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=cra-universal), most recommended of all
- Create a Pull Request with your solutions to your problem

Please, be noted, no one, I mean, no one, is obligated to help you in ANY means.
Remember this is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/antonybudianto/cra-universal/blob/master/LICENSE).
I don't want to see any "why my code didn't work" or "why no update". This is not the primary purpose of the issue tracker. Don't abuse.

You can also fork it as your own if you have specific needs. 

Please keep in mind that any **abuses or rude behavior** will get you **blocked** permanently.

Best regards.
