Welcome to the CRA Universal wiki!

## Introduction
It's a CLI to enable universal create-react-app without ejecting and zero-config by default.

Demo is available at https://cra-universal.now.sh

Contributions are welcomed!

## Non-CRA users
This CLI will probably work on non-CRA users if they follow some of required CRA conventions 
- **src/index.js**, **src/App.js**
- `<div id="root">...</div>`
