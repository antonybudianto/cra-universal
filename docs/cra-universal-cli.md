## Init
```sh
cra-universal init
```

It will copy `./templates/server` into the current directory (it should be run on CRA client root)

## Start
```sh
cra-universal start
```

This will start CRA server for development.
You can also run both client and server by running:
```sh
cra-universal start --both
```


## Build
```sh
cra-universal build
```

This will run `npm run build` on both CRA client and server and then combine them into `./dist` folder. Make sure your `build` npm script is still there

## Clean
```sh
cra-universal clean
```

This command will clean the build result generated by the CLI (dist, build, server-build)
